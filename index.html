<h1>Basement Dog</h1>
<h2>Poem by Crea Wilhelmi</h2>

<p>dog fur tumbleweed drifts across the floor
	<br>the smell of damp concrete, old dreams
	<br>not mine,
	<br>his.
</p>
	
<p>he sits there, whining like a rusty hinge
	<br>gas leak? 
	<br>nah, the plumber said no
	<br>but the dog knows 
	<br>they always know
	<br>desire for a snack then
</p>

<p>his food is in the basement, the black hole
	<br>i tell him to go there
	<br>in the distance a door slams
	<br>echoes
	<br>he whines again pausing only at the sound of footsteps
	<br>not mine…my husband?
	<br>no, he’s upstairs

</p>

<p>he's thirty pounds of pure “don’t touch my squeaky toy”
	<br>but the basement is the enemy
	<br>another whine
	<br>i shoo him again
	<br>down the stairs, he went
	<br>what finally did it?
	<br>chicken nuggets? 
	<br>he pauses, frightened by another sound…
</p>

<p>just the hum of the fridge…
	<br>then the whispers…
	<br>from the basement…
	<br>they’re saying…
	<br>”Treats are in the pantry”

</p>

<h1>wait...WHAT IS THAT?? AHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh.....</h1>
